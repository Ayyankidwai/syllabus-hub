    <h1 >WEB-SEARCH-ENGINE</h1>
    <p>Search engines are the software program that provides information according to the user query. It finds various websites or web pages that are available on the internet and gives related results according to the search.<br>
        To rank well on a Search Engine, it’s important to know What are Search engines and how they work.</p>
    <h2>What are Web Search Engine?</h2>
    <p>A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user's query.<br>
         The user inputs a query within a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are often a list of hyperlinks, accompanied by textual summaries and images.<br>
         Users also have the option of limiting the search to a specific type of results, such as images, videos, or news.<br>
         For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world.<br>
         The speed and accuracy of an engine's response to a query is based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers.<br>
          This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, but some content is not accessible to crawlers.</p>
    <h2>How do the Search Engine Work</h2> 
    <div class="text"> 
        <h2>Search Engine work on three parts that are:</h2>  
        <p>
            <span class="word wisteria">Crawling.</span>
            <span class="word belize">Indexing.</span>
            <span class="word pomegranate">Ranking.</span>
        </p>  
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>CRAWLING: Search engines have a number of computer programs that are responsible for finding information that is publicly available on the internet.<br> 
            The crawler scans the web and creates a list of all available websites. Then they visit each website and by reading HTML code they try to understand the structure of the page,the type of the content,<br>
            the meaning of the content, and when it was created or updated.<br> 
            Why crawling is important? Your first concern when optimizing your website for search engines is to make sure that they can access it correctly.<br>
            If crawler cannot find your content you won’t get any ranking or search engine traffic.</li>
        <li>INDEXING: After a page is crawled, the textual content is processed, analyzed and tagged with attributes and metadata that help the search engine understand what the content is about.<br> 
            This also enables the search engine to weed out duplicate pages and collect signals about the content, such as the country or region the page is local to and the usability of the page.</li>
        <li>RANKING: When a user enters a query, the search engine searches the index for matching pages and returns the results that appear the most relevant on the search engine results page (SERP).<br> 
            The engine ranks content on a number of factors, such as the authoritativeness of a page, back links to the page and keywords a page contains.</li>       
    </ol>
    <h2>How Search Engine Rank Results</h2>
    <p>Not every search engine ranks content the same way, but some have similar ranking algorithms.<br>
       Google search and other search engines like it rank relevant results based on the following criteria:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>QUERY MEANING:</b>
            The search engine looks at user queries to establish searcher intent, which is the specific type of information the user is looking for.<BR>
            Search engines use language models to do this. Language models are algorithms that read user input, understand what it means and determine the type of information that a user is looking for.
        </li>
        <li><b>RELEVANCE:</b> Keywords from search queries are matched to keywords in content. Keywords that appear in several places in the content signify more relevance than others.</li>
        <li><b>QUALITY:</b>Search engines look for indicators of expertise, authority and trustworthiness in the content.<br>
                        If other prominent websites link to the content, it is considered more trustworthy.</li>
        <li><b>USABILITY:</b>Search engines evaluate the accessibility and general user experience of content and reward content with better page experience.<br>
                        One example of page usability is mobile-friendliness, which is a measure of how easy a webpage is to use on a mobile device.</li>
        <li><b>USER DATA:</b>A user's past search history, search settings and location data are a few of the data types search engines use to determine the content rankings they choose.</li>
    </ol> 
    <h2>Components of Search Engine</h2>
        <h3>There are three components in Search Engine</h3>
        <ol>

                                <br>It is basically a software which is also known bat or spider. </li>
            <li><b>DATABASE:</b> The information which is gathered by web crawler by crawling through internet is stored on the database.</li>
            <li><b>SEARCH INTEFACE:</b>Search interface is just an interface to the data base which is employed by the user to search through the data base.</li>
        </ol>
