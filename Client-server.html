        <p>  
            Client-server architecture is a computer network structure where multiple clients (remote processors) request and receive services from a centralized server (host computer). 
            Client computers provide an interface for users to request services from the server and display the results returned. Servers await requests from clients and respond accordingly.
            Ideally, a server provides a standardized, transparent interface so that clients are unaware of the underlying system (hardware and software) providing the service.
            Clients are often situated at workstations or personal computers, while servers are located on more powerful machines elsewhere on the network.
            This computing model is effective when clients and servers have distinct tasks. For example, in hospital data processing, a client computer can enter patient information 
            while the server manages the database where the information is stored. Many clients can access the server simultaneously, and a client computer can perform other tasks like sending emails.
            Unlike the old mainframe model, where a centralized mainframe performed all tasks for its "dumb" terminals, the client-server model treats client and server computers as independent devices.

        <h2>How the Client-Server Model Works</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Client:</strong> In digital terms, a Client is a computer (Host) capable of receiving information or using a service from service providers (Servers).
            <br>
            <strong>Server:</strong> A Server is a remote computer that provides information or access to services.

        <h2>How the Browser Interacts with the Server</h2>
        <h3>Steps to Follow:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>User enters the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or file. The Browser requests the DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) Server.</li>
            <li>DNS Server looks up the address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>The DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the WEB Serverâ€™s IP (provided by the DNS server).</li>
            <li>The Server sends the necessary files for the website.</li>
            <li>The Browser renders the files and displays the website using the DOM (Document Object Model) interpreter, CSS interpreter, and JS Engine (collectively known as the JIT or Just-In-Time Compilers).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of the Client-Server Model</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Centralized system with all data in a single place.</li>
            <li>Cost-efficient, with lower maintenance costs and data recovery options.</li>
            <li>The capacity of Clients and Servers can be adjusted separately.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Disadvantages of the Client-Server Model</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans, and worms if present in or uploaded to the Server.</li>
            <li>Servers are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
            <li>Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Client-server architecture consolidates resources on servers for greater control and security, allows for flexible client options, and relies on a robust network for scalability and efficiency. 
            While there are cost implications, the client-server model remains fundamental and continues to evolve with trends such as cloud computing.
