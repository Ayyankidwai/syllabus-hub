        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people to communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. It was created in the 1960s by the US Department of Defense as a way to connect computers and share information between researchers and scientists.

            The World Wide Web, or simply the web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources, linked together by hyperlinks and URLs. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a way for scientists to share information more easily. The web quickly grew to become the most popular way to access information on the internet.
            
            Together, the internet and the web have revolutionized the way we communicate, do business, and access information. They have made it possible for people all over the world to connect with each other instantly and have transformed many industries, from media and entertainment to education and healthcare.</p><br>
            <p>Internet: In simplest terms, the Internet is a global network comprised of smaller networks that are interconnected using standardized communication protocols. The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite. This model divides methods into a layered system of protocols. 

These layers are as follows:

Application layer (highest) – concerned with the data(URL, type, etc.). This is where HTTP, HTTPS, etc., comes in.
Transport layer – responsible for end-to-end communication over a network.
Network layer – provides data route. </p>
